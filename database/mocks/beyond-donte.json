In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder.

This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Terrify.</strong> While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw.

In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell's level. However, if doing so brings the staff's total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Spells.</strong> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: <strong></strong><strong>conjure elemental</strong> (7 charges), <strong></strong><strong>dispel magic</strong> (3 charges), <strong></strong><strong>fireball</strong> (7th-level version, 7 charges), <strong></strong><strong>flaming sphere</strong> (2 charges), <strong></strong><strong>ice storm</strong> (4 charges), <strong></strong><strong>invisibility</strong> (2 charges), <strong></strong><strong>knock</strong> (2 charges), <strong></strong><strong>lightning bolt</strong> (7th-level version, 7 charges), <strong></strong><strong>passwall</strong> (5 charges), <strong></strong><strong>plane shift</strong> (7 charges), <strong></strong><strong>telekinesis</strong> (5 charges), <strong></strong><strong>wall of fire</strong> (4 charges), or <strong></strong><strong>web</strong> (2 charges).</p>\r\n<p>You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: <strong></strong><strong>arcane lock</strong>, <strong></strong><strong>detect magic</strong>, <strong></strong><strong>enlarge/reduce</strong>, <strong></strong><strong>light</strong>, <strong></strong><strong>mage hand</strong>, or <strong></strong><strong>protection from evil and good</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Retributive Strike.</strong> You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.</p>\r\n<p>You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 &times; the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table.
